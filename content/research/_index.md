Dr. Murillo is passionate about interdisciplinary research, education, and service. The overall goal of her work is to develop and apply innovative statistical, mathematical, and computational methods that contribute to the design and implementation of evidence-based interventions and health policies to improve public health broadly in the areas of chronic and infectious diseases, epidemiology, and health disparities. Her recent work emphasized statistical applications in obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, physical activity, eating behaviors, asthma and health disparities. She collaborates broadly on other topics in infectious diseases and epidemiology both at the within-host (genetic) and population levels. 

Dr. Murillo's methodological interests are in the intersection of statistical inference, mathematical modeling, and simulation studies for the prediction of health outcomes in the context of health policy and interventions. Her current work aims to address methodological problems in designing and analyzing clinical trials with technology-based components while addressing health disparities, inequities in health, and limited resource or hard to reach communities. She is particularly interested in methods addressing missing data, measurement error, and in designing pragmatic clinical trials. At Brown, she is involved with leading the design, conduct and analysis of clinical and translational research (CTR) at the Advance-CTR, Hasbro Childrenâ€™s Hospital, and Women & Infants Hospital.
