Dr. Murillo's methodological interests are in the intersection of statistical inference, mathematical modeling, and simulation studies for the prediction of health outcomes in the context of health policy and interventions. Her current work aims to address methodological problems in designing and analyzing clinical trials with technology-based components while addressing health disparities, inequities in health, and limited resource or hard to reach communities. She is particularly interested in methods addressing missing data, measurement error, and in designing pragmatic clinical trials. At Brown, she is involved with leading the design, conduct and analysis of clinical and translational research (CTR) at the Advance-CTR, Hasbro Childrenâ€™s Hospital, and Women & Infants Hospital.
