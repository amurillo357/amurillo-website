Dr. Murillo's methodological interests are in the intersection of statistical inference, mathematical modeling, and simulation studies for the prediction of health outcomes in the context of health policy and interventions. At Brown, she is involved with leading the design, conduct and analysis of clinical and translational research (CTR) at the Advance-CTR, Hasbro Childrenâ€™s Hospital, and Women & Infants Hospital. Her research interests are in statistical applications in obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, physical activity, eating behaviors, asthma and health disparities. She collaborates broadly on other topics in infectious diseases and epidemiology both at the within-host (genetic) and population levels. 

Dr. Murillo is passionate about interdisciplinary research, education, and service. The overall goal of her work is to improve public health through developing and applying innovative statistical, mathematical, and computational methods that contribute to the design and implementation of evidence-based interventions and health policies in the areas of chronic and infectious diseases, epidemiology, and health disparities.
