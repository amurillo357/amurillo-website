Abstract: While the use of buprenorphine/naloxone to treat OUD shows great promise in curtailing the opioid overdose crisis in the United States, expanding the availability of the treatment of opioid addiction, promoting equity in access, and achieving dramatic and sustained reduction in overdose rate is a challenge for the medical system. By applying and quantifying the OUD care cascade, benchmarks can be established and interventions can be improved, bolstering prevention, treatment, and ensuring more patients remain in recovery. The primary aim is to evaluate factors associated with successful transition and barriers along the opioid use disorder (OUD) care cascade, while considering the time-varying and cyclical nature of this disease and its treatment using a statistical multistate model applied to the RI All-Payer Claims Database (APCD).
