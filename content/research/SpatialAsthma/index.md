title: Spatial Multi-Level Risk Factor Analysis to Predict Asthma Morbidity in Urban Children in Multiethnic Cohort of Children
---

Abstract: The co-occurrence of asthma and obesity puts low-income and urban Latino or African American children at higher risk of Emergency Department (ED) visits in comparison to their healthy weight peers. While key lifestyle behaviors such as regular physical activity and a balanced diet improve asthma control, weight status, and overall health of children, urban environments vary widely in their spatial distribution of local green spaces and grocery stores making these behaviors (physical activity, diet) difficult to achieve.  The primary aims of this study are to evaluate community-level risks of the local neighborhood and how they contribute to key lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, diet) relevant to asthma morbidity (control, hospitalizations, ED visits) in a carefully examined cohort of African American, Latino and Non-Latino white urban children (aged 7-9 years) in Rhode Island.
