I am an Assistant Professor and Senior Biostatistician at Brown University affiliated with the Department of Pediatrics, Warren Alpert Medical School, and Center for Statistical Sciences, School of Public Health. 

In 2019, I joined Brown as a visiting researcher affiliated with the Data Science Initiative and Division of Applied Math, then later joined the Department of Pediatrics, Warren Alpert Medical School, and Center for Statistical Sciences, School of Public Health. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics from Arizona State University (2016). Prior to Brown, I was an NIH T32 postdoctoral fellow in the statistical genetics and obesity training programs in the Department of Biostatistics and NIH-funded Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (2016-19). In 2020, I was selected for the NIH NHLBI PRIDE program as a Research in Implementation Science for Equity (RISE) fellow at the University of California, San Francisco (2020-21).
